    "backgroundStory": "I graduated with a high school diploma in Marketing in 2013. Being a highly self-reliant individual, I actively sought opportunities to swiftly enter the professional sphere. Consequently, I ventured into the private security industry where I honed my skills for over four years. Driven by ambition, I progressed from a security guard to a fireguard technician and eventually attained the position of a private security instructor. Displaying an innate curiosity, I delved into diverse security domains and developed a keen interest in Privacy, Cyber Security, and, ultimately, Computer Science. Following a careful evaluation of my career trajectory, I made the decision to pursue further education and enhance my knowledge in computer networks and software development.",
    "milestones": "Milestones",
    "milestone1": "As an adult returning to academia, I overcame significant challenges to earn an Associate degree in Computing & Software Development and a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Mobile Application Development in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
    "milestone2": "Driven by my passion for engineering, I pursued a Master's degree in Computer Science at Côte d'Azur University, surpassing demanding computer mathematics courses. During this time, I discovered a captivating and humbling aspect of computers.",
    "milestone3": "Continuing my academic journey, I graduated from Polytech in 2022, majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This exposed me to the fascinating realm of Interaction Design and User-Centered Design (UCD) process, incorporating Cognitive Psychology, Ergonomics, Usability, and User Experience, alongside Front-end Engineering.",
    "milestone4": "My exploration in these areas ignited my creativity and led to significant personal growth through the development of projects. This newfound passion drives me forward.",
    "aspirations": "Future Aspirations",
    "aspiration1": "Thanks to my participation in an apprenticeship program alongside my studies, I gained valuable professional experience. I served as a Mobile Developer for one year and as a Web Full Stack Developer for two years in a product-oriented company that adhered to an Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).",
    "aspiration2": "Demonstrating a strong sense of autonomy, I successfully led multiple projects during this time. Noteworthy examples include the integration of Crypto Payments with Coinify and Datatrans, as well as the initiation of a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) approach in User-Centered Design Methods to improve API Usability. For further details, please refer to my resume.",
    "aspiration3": "As I look towards the future, I am eager to embrace new challenges. My engineering proficiency in Software Development, complemented by my expertise in Human-Computer Interaction and User-Centered Design, positions me as a valuable asset for any digital project."
